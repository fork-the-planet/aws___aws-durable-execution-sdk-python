"""Root-logger filter that stamps OTel trace context onto every log record.

The filter attaches to a stdlib logging handler and enriches *every* record
that flows through it: direct ``logging.getLogger().info(...)`` calls,
child-logger records that propagate to root, and third-party library logs.

The span/trace identifiers are added as ``LogRecord`` attributes (using
underscore names, since dotted names are not valid record attributes):

    - ``otel_trace_id``: 32-char hex trace identifier
    - ``otel_span_id``: 16-char hex span identifier
    - ``otel_trace_sampled``: boolean indicating if the trace is sampled

These attributes are only set when a valid span context is active. Records
emitted outside an active invocation (e.g. during Lambda teardown) pass through
unmodified, so any log formatter or schema must treat the fields as optional.

    The filter is attached to each handler on ``target_logger`` (the root logger

    records propagated from child loggers are also enriched, since handler
    filters run for every record reaching the handler.

    This is safe to call on every invocation: if a handler already has an
    OtelContextLogFilter, it is left as-is, so warm Lambda reuse will not stack
    duplicate filters. A single shared filter instance is reused across all
