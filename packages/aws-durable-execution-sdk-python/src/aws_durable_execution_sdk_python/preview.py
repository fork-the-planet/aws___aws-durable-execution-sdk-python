"""Preview generation utilities for durable function checkpoints.

This module provides a standalone utility for building compact preview objects
from values. Previews can be stored inline in checkpoint envelopes to make key
fields visible in the console and API without reading the full stored data.

The preview system is designed to be used with any SerDes implementation — not
just the filesystem serdes. For example, you could use build_preview with a
custom DynamoDB-backed serdes or any other external storage serdes.

    Traverses the object tree and collects fields based on the include/exclude/mask
    rules in config. The result is a nested object mirroring the original structure,
    capped at config.max_preview_bytes (default 4096 bytes).

    Priority rules:
    - exclude always wins — excluded fields are never shown, even if in mask
    - mask implies visibility — masked fields are shown (with mask_string) unless
      excluded

    Limitations:
    - Field names containing dots are not supported (indistinguishable from path
      separators)
    - Array structure is not preserved — fields from array elements are merged
      into a plain object at the array's path
    - When array elements have heterogeneous shapes at the same field path,
      later elements overwrite earlier primitives in the preview

    Args:
        value: The value to build a preview from.
        config: Preview configuration.

    Returns:
        A nested dict representing the preview, or None if no fields are visible
        or value is not a dict/object.
