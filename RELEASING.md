# Releasing

This document describes how to cut a release for packages in this monorepo and how the automated PyPI publishing workflow is triggered.

## Packages

This monorepo contains the following packages:

| Package | Path | Tag Prefix |
|---------|------|------------|
| `aws-durable-execution-sdk-python` | `packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python` | `sdk` |
| `aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel` | `packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel` | `otel` |

## Versioning

Each package maintains its own version in its respective `__about__.py` file:

- SDK: `packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python/src/aws_durable_execution_sdk_python/__about__.py`
- OTel: `packages/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel/src/aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_otel/__about__.py`

Bump the version in the appropriate `__about__.py` file(s) and merge to `main` before creating a release.

## Cutting a Release

### 1. Bump the version

Update the `__version__` string in the relevant `__about__.py` file(s). Commit and merge to `main`.

### 2. Create a GitHub Release

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/aws/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python/releases) on GitHub.
2. Click **Draft a new release**.
3. Create a new tag following the tagging convention below.
4. Set the release title (typically the same as the tag).
5. Write release notes following the format described in [Release Notes Format](#release-notes-format).
6. Click **Publish release**.

### Tagging Convention

The tag should be the version of the package being bumped, prepended with a descriptive prefix:

- **SDK only:** `sdk-v<version>` (e.g., `sdk-v1.6.0`)
- **OTel only:** `otel-v<version>` (e.g., `otel-v0.3.0`)
- **Both packages in a single release:** comma-separate the sub-tags (e.g., `sdk-v1.6.0,otel-v0.3.0`)

Examples:

```
sdk-v1.6.0
otel-v0.3.0
sdk-v1.6.0,otel-v0.3.0
```

If additional packages are added to the monorepo in the future, follow the same pattern: choose a short descriptive prefix for the package and use `<prefix>-<version>`.

## How Publishing Works

Creating a GitHub Release triggers the [`pypi-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml) workflow automatically. The workflow:

1. **Builds** both packages using [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) (`hatch build`).
2. **Uploads** the built distributions as artifacts.
3. **Publishes** each package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) using trusted publishing (OIDC-based, no API tokens required).

The workflow runs on the `release: [published]` event, so it fires whenever a release is published on GitHub — no manual intervention is needed beyond creating the release.

> **Note:** The workflow builds and publishes all packages in the matrix. Ensure the version in each package's `__about__.py` is correct before publishing. If only one package has a version bump, PyPI will reject the re-upload of the unchanged package (which is expected and harmless since `fail-fast: false` is set).

## Release Notes Format

Release notes should maintain separate timelines for each package. Use the following structure:

```markdown
## aws-durable-execution-sdk-python v1.6.0

### Features
- Added support for X
- New `context.foo()` API

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue with Y under Z conditions

### Breaking Changes
- Removed deprecated `bar()` method

---

## aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel v0.3.0

### Features
- Added tracing for `map` operations

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed span context propagation in child contexts
```

If only one package is being released, include only that package's section. Each package's changelog should be self-contained so users can follow the history of the package they depend on independently.

## Checklist

Before publishing a release:

- [ ] Version bumped in the relevant `__about__.py` file(s)
- [ ] Changes merged to `main`
- [ ] CI checks pass on `main`
- [ ] Release notes written with separate sections per package
- [ ] Tag follows the naming convention (`sdk-X.Y.Z`, `otel-X.Y.Z`, or comma-separated)
